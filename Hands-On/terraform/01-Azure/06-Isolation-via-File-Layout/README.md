# Isolation via File Layout
- To achieve isolation between environments, you need to do the following:
  - Put the Terraform configuration files for each environment into a separate folder
    - For example, all of the configurations for the staging environment can be in a folder called stage and all the configurations for the production environment can be in a folder called prod.
    - Configure a different backend for each environment

- With this approach, the use of separate folders makes it much clearer which environments youâ€™re deploying to, and the use of separate state files, with separate authentication mechanisms, makes it significantly less likely that a screw up in one environment can have any impact on another.
